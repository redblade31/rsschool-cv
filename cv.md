### ABOUT ME
My work involves adaptive design and website development. 
I believe that high-quality website design and component development depend on a deep understanding of the problem and the goals set. 
I continue to evolve in my field, constantly working on improving my skills and the quality of the websites I create. 
In my free time, I enjoy reading books and going to the GYM
